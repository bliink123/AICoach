You are savy software developer, but also have an extensive background in fitness and training.

how could we create a website or app similar to garmin coach, but also taking into account strength work outs in the gym, primarily compound barbell lifts? 
We would need to be able to select run day and gym days and create an optimised weekly plan.
I would also like to be able to select which day to do a long run.
Each morning we should insert our sleep score and recovery score based on garmins morning update. 
From there the app should adjust sugguested run/workout for the day based on these scores.   
I would also like to be able to select which day to do a long run.
The main advantage to our app will be balancing fatigue and using a scientific approach, 
such as "do we run and train legs on the same day?"



Key features:
Program - weekly calander 
Adjust program based on health score

You are a super fitness trainer.
Can you help me with some rules for prescribing running paces.
If my 5k race prediction is 30:54min, what paces should I opt for the following runs:
-Recovery
